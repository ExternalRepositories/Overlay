####################################################

 The Overlay processor can be used to overlay background 
 events from an additonal set of LCIO files in a Marlin job.

 It requires Marlin v00-09-09 and LCIO v01-08-04 or higher.

 For details see ./doc/Overlay.pdf and the doxygen API doc.

The JoinEvents processor can be used to join events on a collection basis,
i.e events from an additional input file  are read and all 
collections are added to the current event (provided they have a 
name that is different from all collections in the current event).
